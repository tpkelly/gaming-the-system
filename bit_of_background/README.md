# Bit of Background

To start with, what is Gamification? Taking straight from the Oxford English Dictionary, Gamification is:

“The application of `typical elements of game playing` to other areas of activity, typically as an online marketing technique to `encourage engagement` with a product or service.”

So how do we encourage engagement and motivate people? Motivation can (very loosely) be broken down into two types; Internal (or Intrinsic) and External (or Extrinsic) Motivation.

## Motivation

*Internal Motivation* is motivation from within. This is motivation through having a vested interest in the task at hand. This could be because of a hobby or passion for the task.

*External Motivation* is motivation from outside forces. This is often by being told to do something, the reward of completion of the task, or the punishment for failure to complete the task.

Both forms of motivation are important. Internal motivation is a much stronger force than External motivation, but also more fragile. If you keep hitting a wall while trying to accomplish a task, the repeated failures can be demoralising and cause you to lose the passion for the task. On the other hand, External motivation is much less likely to go away, but is not as strong as Internal motivation, particularly if you want to do something which doesn't align with the outside forces' desired outcome.

External motivation can also be the demoralising factor which destroys the Internal motivation, especially when it comes to failure mechanics. Imagine that every time you were handed a task at work, you get told "If this isn't done by the end of the day, you're fired". Even if you complete each task on time, you would still feel worse about it than if nothing had been said at all.
