# Introduction

My first introduction to the world of games was on a late-night Ferry travelling to Calais. I was 4 and couldn't sleep, so my Aunt handed me a Gameboy and Tetris to try and tire me out and get me to sleep quicker. In the end, nobody slept, and I discovered a whole new world.

I describe myself as a "Gamer". Someone who has played and enjoyed video games over a period spanning decades, console wars, and hundreds of games. From addictively simple Tetris, to Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games (MMORPGs), where coordination between dozens of players is required. From highly glossed games to some where the graphics are intentionally low-key. Sagas spanning Galaxies, and tales of Princesses in other castles.

I genuinely love games, and have a particular interest in the underlying mechanics. In recent years, the word "Gamification" has become widespread,
especially amongst marketting teams. Here, I take an overview of where it comes from, what it means, and how it might be useful for your own projects.

Online, I am "Kazenone66", and primarily play on [Xbox Live](http://live.xbox.com/en-US/profile/profile.aspx?GamerTag=Kazenone66). If you want to find out what kind of games I play, I am also on a [stat tracking site](http://www.trueachievements.com/gamerstats.aspx?gamerid=300795) with a good genre breakdown.
