### In brief

1. The best motivators for players come about when multiplayer gameplay is introduced, either through competitive or co-operative play.

1.
Likewise, the rewards and punishment from the game needs to be as immediate as possible, if not instantaneous.

1.
The gameplay needs to be designed around the problem to be solved, and not just bolted on. Having a clear gap between the fun parts and the parts you need will result in users losing interest.

1.
Not every problem needs to be gamified; sometimes it just adds needless complication to an otherwise simple process. Avoid "Gamification for Gamification sake" at all costs.

1.
Do not game anything vital, as users will try to exploit it, and might make your system worse.

Gamification can be very rewarding if you pull it off, but don't expect it to be easy. It requires as much design and thought as any other part of software, so give it time to get it right.

Have fun!
