# Epilogue

Gamification can be very rewarding if you pull it off, but don't expect it to be easy. It requires as much design and thought as any other part of software, so give it time to get it right.

The key points of this book are summarised below.

### Motivation from Games

Internal motivation is motivation powered by engagement and interest. Examples of game mechanics using internal motivation include;

* Points and Score
* Leaderboards
* Achievements and Challenges
* Plot

External motivation is motivation from outside sources directing the player towards goals and objectives, either with punishment or reward. Examples of game mechanics using external motivation include;

* Rules of play
* Time limits
* Unlockable content
* Money
* Failure mechanics

A balance of internal and external motivation is key to successfully directing a player in the direction you want, whilst keeping them interested in your product.

### In brief


1. The best motivators for players come about when multiplayer gameplay is introduced, either through competitive or co-operative play.

1. Likewise, the rewards and punishment from the game needs to be as immediate as possible, if not instantaneous.

1. The gameplay needs to be designed around the problem to be solved, and not just bolted on. Having a clear gap between the fun parts and the parts you need will result in users losing interest.

1. Not every problem needs to be gamified; sometimes it just adds needless complication to an otherwise simple process. Avoid "Gamification for Gamification sake" at all costs.

1. Do not game anything vital, as users will try to exploit it, and might make your system worse.

Once again, gamification is a hard thing to get right, but will improve engagement and customer loyalty if you can pull it off! Expect to have to invest a lot of time, effort and money in creating the right approach, but most of all...

Have fun!
